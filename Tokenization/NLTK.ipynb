A. government made him the contender for the post of leader of India in 2002. With about 90% vote, he swore as the eleventh president of India on 25 July 2002 in Parliament within sight of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his bureau of ministers.\n",

    "Sir Abdul Kalam was a vegan and carefully followed discipline throughout his life. Even though he didn’t have connections with a political field, he was politically productive on account of his idea of patriotism and his devotion towards open government assistance. He has been the central President who has never had any association with legislative issues or political exercises.\n",
